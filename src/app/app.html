<!-- APP.HTML - THE MAIN CONTAINER TEMPLATE FOR OUR ENTIRE INSURANCE APPLICATION -->
<!-- ================================================================================================ -->
<!-- This is the "master template" that gets inserted into <app-root> in index.html. -->
<!-- It defines the overall layout structure that stays consistent across all pages. -->
<!-- User Experience: This template provides the foundation where all page content gets injected. -->
<!-- 
     ARCHITECTURE FLOW:
     1. Browser loads index.html
     2. Angular replaces <app-root> with THIS template
     3. Angular replaces <router-outlet> with the current page component
     4. User sees: Navigation + Current Page Content
-->

<!-- ðŸ”„ ROUTER OUTLET - The Dynamic Content Area -->
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
<!-- 
     EXPLANATION: This special Angular tag gets replaced with different components based on the current URL:
     - /quote-form â†’ Displays QuoteForm component (insurance application form)
     - /quote-results/123 â†’ Displays QuoteResults component (calculated premiums)
     - /saved-quotes â†’ Displays SavedQuotes component (quote history)
     
     HOW IT WORKS: Angular Router uses app.routes.ts to determine which component to inject here.
     It's like a "placeholder" that changes content based on navigation, creating the Single Page App experience.
     
     USER EXPERIENCE: Users see different content in this space, but the overall app structure stays the same.
     This creates smooth transitions between pages without full page reloads.
